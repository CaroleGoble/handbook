### Requesting a modification

If you do not want to modify the content directly or you are not yet confident enough on doing this you can write a request and suggest modifications in there. 

First you copy the web address that points to the page that you would like to see changed to some extent. Then you click on the git icon on the bottom of that document to directly bring you to the GitHub repository in which all the content is stored.

{% include image.html file="/github.png" alt="" caption="" %}

Then you click on the issue tab.

{% include image.html file="/github_issue.png" alt="" caption="" %}

When you are on the issue page you can request a new issue by clicking on the big green (New issue) button.

You then enter a small editor in which you can place the URL that you copied to make it easier to find out which web page you would like to see changed and then you can write about the content you would like to add / remove / modify. When you have completed the issue you can click **Submit new issue**. In addition you can also assign this issue directly to someone that is part of this project.

### Requesting a new page

If you want to request a completely new page you can create a new issue on GitHub stating what kind of page you would like to create and where on the website you want it to be located.
