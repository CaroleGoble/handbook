Common harmonized reporting is needed for the successful implementation of seamless multi-facility services. Services offered by IBISBA are executed as projects and should be recorded in a way that allows future projects to benefit from past projects. The executed projects thus require a common, but flexible reporting template for capturing what was done. 

The IBISBA Reporting Template provides a template for the final reporting of any entity of work (project) done within IBISBA. Project reporting is a means to convey information such as results to a client that has commissioned the work to be done. A single template will be used for all reporting purposes regardless of the size, confidentiality, or complexity of the project. Specific sections/chapters can be extracted and used where they are needed. Specific sections/chapters can be made confidential (to protect IPR). A public version of the report can be made by extracting all non-confidential sections/chapters.

The current goal is a minimum - a good starting point that can later be improved.  Project reports should reflect how a TNA project was built from a series of modules and workflows. However, it has already been identified that the current minimum will not be good enough in the future (e.g. within 3-5 years). Stricter requirements are expected because the ultimate goal is to offer seamless multi-facility services via the EU-IBISBA legal entity.
You can find the reporting template [here](https://doi.org/10.34701/IBISBA.1.FILETEMPLATE.2.1). 

Presently, the IBISBA Reporting Template is available only to IBISBA 1.0 consortium members under the access provisions specified in the IBISBA 1.0 Consortium Agreement.
