IBISBA involves multiple disciplines and countries having slightly different definitions and typical use of terms. With English not being the primary language, yet being the common language in use, inexact terms have become typical in certain regions and cultures. The IBISBA Terminology is a coherent set of words and phrases that have been agreed upon within the IBISBA Enterprise to advocate common underestanding. The ultimate goal is to harmonize the use of terms and their definitions across all operations within the IBISBA Enterprise.

The words and phrases listed below are a small subset of the IBISBA Termbase. The full list of past, present, and potential future terms is found online in a location chosen by the Terminology Taskforce.

You may contribute new terms and definitions either directly through the IBISBA Terminology Taskforce or via IBISBA Management.

| Word or phrase                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Investigation                       | a high level description of the overall area of research. This may be the overall aims of the project, as stated on your grant. If your project has several subprojects that do not share any data, you should define an investigation for each.                                             |
| Study                               | a particular biological hypothesis, which you are planning to test in various ways, using various techniques, which could be experimental, informatics, modelling, or a mixture                                                                                                              |
| Assay                               | specific, individual experiments, measurements, or modelling tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Service                             | Conceptual level item in the service-oriented view. Describes "what" is done. A service comprises several phases or partitions of activity. A sequence of processes initiated and terminated by a client role, delivered via an interface role, and controlled or constrained by a contract. |
| Function                            | Conceptual level item in the function-oriented view. Describes "what" is done. An enterprise capability represented by a normalized grouping of processes which share a common objective, aim, or goal.                                                                                      |
| Orchestration = Process composition | Logical level item in the service-oriented view. Describes "how" things are done. Process compositions may include alternative process flow paths. A sequence of processes which may implement all or part of a service and be undertaken by actors within one or more communities.          |
| Process                             | Logical level item in both views. Describes "how" things are done. Processes correspond to one of the sub-communities within the parent process composition. Processes includes logical actor roles as lanes. A sequence of tasks undertaken by actors within a single community.            |
| Task                                | Physical level item in both views. Tasks within the processes do not bridge lanes. A sequence of steps undertaken by an individual actor that results in the change in state of the object being acted upon.                                                                                 |
| Step                                | Physical level item in both views. Activity which results in a change to an attribute of an object.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
