IBISBA involves multiple disciplines and countries having slightly different definitions and typical use of terms. With English not being the primary language, yet being the common language in use, inexact terms have become typical in certain regions and cultures. The IBISBA Terminology is a coherent set of words and phrases that have been agreed upon within the IBISBA Enterprise to advocate common underestanding. The ultimate goal is to harmonize the use of terms and their definitions across all operations within the IBISBA Enterprise.

The words and phrases listed below are a small subset of the IBISBA Termbase. The full list of past, present, and potential future terms is found online in a location chosen by the Terminology Taskforce.

You may contribute new terms and definitions either directly through the IBISBA Terminology Taskforce or via IBISBA Management.

| [Access](#access)                         | ‘Access’ refers to the legitimate and authorised physical, remote and virtual admission to, interactions with and use of Research Infrastructures and to services offered by Research Infrastructures to Users. Such Access can be granted, amongst others, to machine time, computing resources, software, data, data-communication services, trust and authentication services, sample preparation, archives, collections, the set-up, execution and dismantling of experiments, education and training, expert support and analytical services. |
| Accessible                     | A resource is Accessible if it meets the following criteria. A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol. A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable. A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary. A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.                                                                                                                                                |
