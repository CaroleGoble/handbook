### 1. Who is this section meant for?
 
This section targets both IBISBA partners and the IBISBA user community, and is also useful for research facility owners and operators that would like to know how they can join IBISBA’s network of facilities.
  

### 2. How will this section help the reader?

The reader can find a first overview of IBISBA’s main features in the first subsection detailing the vision of the infrastructure, its mission and its overarching goals.
The “Internal Management” subsection describes essential management procedures and governance bodies, while the “Getting involved with IBISBA” subsection provides a brief explanation of the different organizational levels that characterize IBISBA and describes the formalities that must be accomplished to join the network. It will also explain what it means to be part of IBISBA and how services are added to the European catalogue.


### 3. What is the learning outcome of this section?  
 
The key aspects of the infrastructure are described in the first sub-section.
The internal management procedures sub-section provides partners with an at-a-glance overview of vital management processes and the governance bodies that are currently operational. 
The getting involved in IBISBA sub-section provides a step by step guide to joining the IBISBA community. Specifically, candidate parties will discover the Memorandum of understanding and the basic rules that apply to the IBISBA community.Readers of this section will also get an understanding of how IBISBA is dealing with tarification and IPR management. 
Finally, use of the sub-section on communication will provide readers with straightforward information on how to communicate on IBISBA using community assets such as the official logo.

### 5. Summary

Management of IBISBA reflects the current status, which stems from ongoing H2020 projects. However, as IBISBA moves towards a more permanent status, management procedures and governance bodies will evolve, especially once a legal entity is created.
Currently, in the absence of a legal entity, a memorandum of understanding is being used to federate interested parties. The use of the MoU is described.
Regarding tarification and IPR management, these are issues under development and so the principles described are only guidelines at this stage.
  
  
### 6. Frequently asked questions?

* What is the role of national nodes? 
  
  Within the boundaries of a national territory, nodes draw together research infrastructure services that are relevant to IBISBA’s mission. 
  National nodes are thus responsible for generating IBISBA’s service offer.

* Who is my national node Chairperson? 
  
  If you can’t identify the person in charge of your national node, please contact us at info@ibisba.eu.

* What if IBISBA does not have a national node in my country? 
  
  If IBISBA is not present in your country, you can make direct contact with IBISBA Central (info@ibisba.eu). It might be possible to create a national 
  node. However, this requires considerable effort on your part, because as the founding member you will need to engage with your national authorities.

* Why does IBISBA need an MoU? 
  
  As explained, IBISBA is currently in preparation and does not benefit from legal status. This deprives IBISBA of membership financial contributions, 
  notably  from member countries. The MoU is thus a temporary measure to federate parties around a common cause. It fixes some ground rules and 
  incites signatories to contribute to IBISBA. Contributions are mainly in-kind, for example providing person-months to perform essential tasks.

* Can an application to access the MoU be refused? 
  
  Yes, this could happen if the General Assembly majoritarily votes to refuse access. This might occur if there is some sort of conflict of interest, or if
  the General Assembly considers that the candidate party’s reputation or mission is somehow incompatible with IBISBA’s vision and/or mission.

* Is it likely that a service is not included in the IBISBA pan-European catalogue? 
  
  Yes, because the conditions are stringent and the service must relate to demand. Moreover, the service catalogue aims to duplicate essential services that 
  are subject to high demand, while avoiding unnecessary redundancy.

* Can a service be proposed at the National level, within the framework of a National node, but not be available in the IBISBA pan-European catalogue? 
 
  Yes, within the current framework, this is perfectly feasible. IBISBA Central does not yet have any formal agreements with national nodes regarding 
  operations that are not treated directly by IBISBA Central. Once the legal entity exists, this might evolve.
