### 5. Summary

Management of IBISBA reflects the current status, which stems from ongoing H2020 projects. However, as IBISBA moves towards a more permanent status, management procedures and governance bodies will evolve, especially once a legal entity is created.
Currently, in the absence of a legal entity, a memorandum of understanding is being used to federate interested parties. The use of the MoU is described.
Regarding tarification and IPR management, these are issues under development and so the principles described are only guidelines at this stage.
