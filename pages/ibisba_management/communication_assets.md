IBISBA’s activities and its developments are conveyed through a set of channels and tools, which serve as support for IBISBA members and to reach out to IBISBA global user community.

### Logo

The IBISBA logo (word mark and circular symbol) are trademarks protected and registered with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) as of 8 December 2020 till 22 July 2030. The registration certificates are available on [SharePoint](https://idp.inra.fr/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.inra.fr%2Fidp%2FAuthn%2FRemoteUser). The protection covers 5 classes of activities (9, 35, 41, 42 and 45), which prevent other organisations from using the same logo in Europe (not only EU) in the same field of activities.

INRAE is the owner of the logo and will grant all IBISBA partners with licenses to use it in the usual conditions of exploitation.

### Brand and Visual Identity Management Policy

A distinctive communication style is necessary to be convincing in a “communication saturated environment”. It is also a clear message to all of the members of the Consortium as well as the stakeholders that IBISBA is evolving and moving forward. Creating a stronger identity is a must do to support the evolution of the communication strategy. 

The policy serves this purpose by defining the IBISBA branding, the visual identity of the Consortium and the rules of use for the different elements it includes. 

The policy also protects the logo of the Consortium against misuses, in its use or in its shape. The policy will be used by IBISBA members when producing any IBISBA product. It shall also be used by contractors who are entitled to deliver graphics.

All communication tools will be adapted to the policy for greater consistency.

The brand and visual management policy is available on [SharePoint](https://idp.inra.fr/cas/loginservice=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.inra.fr%2Fidp%2FAuthn%2FRemoteUser).
