## Contribution process  
The handbook is hosted on Github. We appreciate that many people are inexperienced and uncomfortable about using Github. 
Therefore, to make it easy we provide you the option to contribute via Google docs


•	Email the editorial team at handbook-editors@ibisba.org to propose a new page or a new section in an existing page. 
  Make sure you keep other contributors in the CC of your email. The editors will create an issue the GitHub repository 
  to announce your contribution to others.  
•	Go to the Handbook Space  and copy the google doc template provided there and name it with the title of the page you want to contribute.  
•	Notify the editorial team when you are finished.  
•	The editors will assign reviewers to your page, who will provide feedback as comments on the shared google doc and will notify you.  
•	Address the reviewers’ comments and let the editorial team know, again by mail, that you’re finished with revisions.  
•	The editors will transfer your page to GitHub and let you know when it is published on the website.
