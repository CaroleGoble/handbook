## How to contribute to the Handbook website 

### Ways of contributing
  All the IBISBA community is welcome to contribute to this site, and we’ve tried to make it as easy as possible. Choose a way that suits you. The handbook is hosted on Github. We appreciate that many people are inexperienced and uncomfortable about using Github. Therefore, to make it easy we have two Options of contributing: 

  •	**Option A** : If you are happier using Google Docs: follow the Google Doc way.  
  
  •	**Option B** : If you are even slightly familiar with Git and want to give it a try on GitHub: follow our step-by-step instructions
                 (no technical knowledge required!).  
                 
                 
### Contributor responsibilities
  
• We give great importance to authorship credit. If others were involved in your contribution, by writing up or by providing resources such as diagrams or links, 
  please make sure you acknowledge them in the contributors’ section of your page.
  
### Attribution of the contributors
• Contributors will be shown at the bottom of the page if listed in the metadata of the markdown file.
