## How to contribute to the Handbook website 

### Ways of contributing
  All the IBISBA community is welcome to contribute to this site, and we’ve tried to make it as easy as possible. 
  The website is hosted on GitHub and you can choose the ay of contribution that suits you.   

   -	**Google Doc Way** : If you are happier using Google Docs: follow the [instructions](https://ibisba.github.io./handbook/google_doc_way.html).    
  
   -  **Github Way** : If you are even slightly familiar with Github and want to give it a try: follow our [step-by-step instructions](https://ibisba.github.io./handbook/github_way.html) (no technical knowledge is required!).  
                 
                 
### Contributor responsibilities
  
  - We give great importance to **authorship credit**. If others were involved in your contribution, by writing up or by providing resources such as diagrams or links, 
  please make sure you acknowledge them in the contributors’ section of your page.
  
### Attribution of the contributors
  - Contributors will be shown at the bottom of the page if listed in the metadata of the markdown file.
