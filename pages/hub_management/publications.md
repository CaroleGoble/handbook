# Publications

If a publication has a PubMed ID, or a DOI, then information about the publication may be imported into IBISBAHub. The publication may be associated with specific projects. In addition, the authors of the publication are, where possible, reconciled to the people registered in IBISBAHub.

# DOI generation

IBISBAHub allows the generation of DOIs for assets that are registered. In order for an asset to be given a DOI, it must be public. In addition, after the assignment of a DOI the asset is fixed i.e. it can only be changed by also retracting the DOI.
