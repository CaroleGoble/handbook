[The technological Research Centre of Finland ](https://www.vttresearch.com/)(VTT) is an impartial multidisciplinary expert organisation. VTT produces research, development, testing and information services to public sector and companies as well as international organisations. VTT can combine different technologies, create new innovations and a substantial range of world class technologies and applied research services. VTT has an automated high throughput platform for strain and enzyme screening. In addition, VTT has extensive pilot facilities related to biomass treatment, chemistry, biotechnical production. Collectively, these technologies are used to establish bioprocesses from strain design, engineering and process upscaling.

### Infrastructure made available to IBISBA 1.0

[VTT Industrial Biotechnology](https://www.vttresearch.com/services/bioeconomy/key-technology-platforms-for-bioeconomy) **(VTT IB)** focuses its research on high-throughput selection and testing of production strains and strain physiology, as well as optimisation, upscaling and piloting of microbial fermentations supported by bioinformatics and modelling tools.

### VTT IB provides access to the following installations

**- VTT-Bioreactors** is a bioreactor and bioprocess suite for parallel strain evaluation, process optimisation and process scale-up.

**- VTT-HTS** is a robotic system which allows high throughput screening of large number of transformed cells and/or culture conditions as well as analysis of a wide range of compounds to be used for off-line fermentation analysis.
