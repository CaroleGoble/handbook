[[The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission](http://www.cea.fr/english/Pages/Welcome.aspx) (CEA) is dedicated to connecting the worlds of research and industry. It is one of the most prominent players in research and innovation in France and throughout the world. It is a key player in research, development and innovation in four main areas: defence and security, nuclear energy (fission and fusion), technological research for industry, fundamental research in the physical sciences and life sciences.

**[Genoscope](http://jacob.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/Pages/Departements/Genoscope.aspx)**[ ](http://jacob.cea.fr/drf/ifrancoisjacob/Pages/Departements/Genoscope.aspx)focuses its research activity on the metagenomics of microorganisms from the environment, the human digestive tract and those involved in effluent treatment. Genoscope is searching for biological solutions in chemical synthesis to reduce pollution, energy and fossil fuel consumption, through the discovery of new biocatalysts.

**[HelioBiotec](http://www-heliobiotec.cea.fr/index-en.html)**[ ](http://www-heliobiotec.cea.fr/index-en.html)is a platform of the Biosciences and Biotechnology Institute of Aix-Marseille University (BIAM) jointly operated by CEA, CNRS and Aix-Marseille University. HelioBiotec develops microalgal strains for industrial production of energy-rich or high-value compounds. Research activity combines approaches of genetics and synthetic biology, based on high-throughput screening, assessment of strain performance (lab-scale photobioreactors, photosynthetic efficiency) and analysis of biomass composition, particularly lipidomics.
