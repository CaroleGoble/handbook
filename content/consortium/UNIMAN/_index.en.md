[The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/) (UNIMAN) is the largest single-site university in the UK, with research strength across all scientific disciplines. In this proposal, UNMIAN is represented by the Manchester institute of Biotechnology (MIB) and by the School of Computer Science.

### Infrastructures made available to IBISBA 1.0

\- The MIB based, UK Research Council funded Synthetic Biology (SynBio) Research Centre, ([**SYNBIOCHEM**](http://synbiochem.co.uk/)[)](http://synbiochem.co.uk/), is harnessing SynBio to develop faster, more predictable, novel routes for fine and speciality chemicals production to deliver new chemical diversity towards scale-up and industrial manufacturing.

**- [FAIRDOM](https://fair-dom.org/)**[ ](https://fair-dom.org/)is a platform set to establish a data and model management service facility for Systems Biology. FAIRDOM supports researchers, students, trainers, funders and publishers by enabling Systems Biology projects to make their data, operating procedures and models Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)
