[The National Research Council ](https://www.cnr.it/en)(CNR) of Italy is the largest public organisation that aims to carry out, spread, transfer and improve research activities in the main sectors of knowledge growth and of its applications for the scientific, technological, economic and social development of the Country. CNR is distributed all over Italy through a network of institutes, promoting a wide diffusion of its competences throughout the national territory, and facilitating contacts and cooperation with local firms and organisations.

### Infrastructures made available to IBISBA 1.0

ProtEnz is a CNR multisite and multidisciplinary infrastructure focusing its research on the discovery, production, characterisation and engineering of proteins and enzymes, with special focus on extremophiles.

### ProtEnz provides access to the following installations

[IBBR-Naples](http://ibbr.cnr.it/ibbr/) (Institute of Biosciences and BioResources) is focused on the discovery and engineering of protein and enzymes, with special focus on carbohydrate active enzymes, from organisms growing in extreme environments and working at optimal operational conditions at the interface between chemistry and biology.

[ISPAAM-Naples](http://www.ispaam.cnr.it/?lang=en) (Institute for the Animal Production System in the Mediterranean Environment) works on quantitative proteomics of organisms having biotechnological interest or of target cells after treatment with biotechnological products, characterisation of recombinant proteins with special focus on post-translational modifications (PTMs), interactomics of recombinant proteins from prokaryotic/eukaryotic sources.

[ISA-Avellino](http://www.isa.cnr.it/web/) (Institute of Food Sciences) studies the design and development of optical protein biosensors, based on recombinant enzymes/proteins, for continuous monitoring of analyses during industrial processes.

[IBBA-Milan-Lodi](http://www.ibba.cnr.it/index.php/en) (Institute of Agricultural Biolopgy and Biotechnology) is focused on the optimisation of protein expression and secretion in eukaryotic hosts, analysis of protein folding in the co- and post-translational modifications during the secretory pathway, environmental metagenomics for the identification of novel microorganisms and for the screening of industrial enzymes.
