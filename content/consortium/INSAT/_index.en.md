[The Institut National des Sciences Appliqu√©es of Toulouse ](http://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html)(INSAT) is an international pluridisciplinary Engineering School, which is recognised for the excellence of its five-year education. INSA-Toulouse provides a range of eight engineering specialisations, including computer sciences, civil engineering, mathematical engineering and biochemical engineering. Its courses are supported by the activity of leading-edge research laboratories, backed by large industrial groups, in aeronautics, nano materials and environmental protection techniques

### Infrastructure made available to IBISBA 1.0

[**LISBP** ](http://www.lisbp.fr/en/index.html)(The Biological Systems and Biochemical Engineering) is a Joint Research Unit (UMR) associated with INRA, CNRS, INSAT and located on the INSA-Toulouse Campus. Internationally recognised, the LISBP stands out as a pioneer for the innovative way it associates Life Sciences and Engineering Sciences, as well as for its advances in fundamental and applied Biology, Microbiology, Microbial Physiology and Metabolism, Engineering, Fermentation and Processes. The LISBP research work has very large applications in Industrial Biotechnology such as Bioenergy and Green Chemistry, Water Treatment, Food Processing and Health

### LISBP provides access to the following installations

**- [MetaToul](https://www6.toulouse.inra.fr/metatoul_eng/)** provides expertise and state-of-the-art MS &NMR methods that allow getting a detailed picture of microbial metabolomes and their response to genetic or environmental change to support functional genomics or system biology projects

**- [GeT](https://www.genotoul.fr/en/)**[ ](https://www.genotoul.fr/en/)*(Trasncriptome-Biochips)* is a platform supporting a wide array of genomics and transcriptomics projects by using microarray technology or new generation sequencing (NGS) on eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes.

**- [I-CEO](http://www.lisbp.fr/en/technology_platforms/iceo.html)** *(Combinatorial engineering and high throughput screening of original enzymes)* is backed by adequate analytical and purification/characterization facilities, provide the means to efficiently explore and characterize protein function diversity and improve protein properties: mutant libraries construction (rational, semi-rational, directed evolution), metagenomic library screening, ad hoc screening assay development, enzyme characterization
