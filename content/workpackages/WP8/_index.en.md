**Consortium coordination and program management**

IBISBA 1.0 is a quite complex project with an extensive partnership. Therefore, good overall management will be central for success. In close cooperation with all WP leaders, the management team will ensure that project progress is in conformity with the work plan and that milestones and deliverables are achieved. Moreover, the management team will monitor the use of financial resources, ensure a good level of internal communication, and generally work within a framework of good managerial practice, applying EC rules and procedures.
