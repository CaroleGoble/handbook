**Improving interoperability among industrial biotechnology operators**

WP6 will focus on the various steps of the DBTL (design, build, test, learn) cycle and simultaneously demonstrate the capacity of the IBISBA 1.0 network to perform collaborative work in a framework of standardised and shared protocols and harmonised procedures. To achieve this a multi-partner task force, including early stage postdoctoral researchers will be assembled to perform DBTL cycles on target host strains. At the design step, tools specific for strain design (e.g. genome-wide multi-pathway models and pathway prediction tools) will be deployed alongside flowsheet/process modelling, thus providing early integration of industrial constraints and decisionmaking features. In the build step, a range of technical operations (e.g. DNA synthesis, assembly and genome engineering using for example CRISPR-Cas9) will be used, employing or developing standard operating protocols (SOPs) that will form part of the network shared assets. Moreover, at this stage focus will be given to microtiter scale high-throughput screening, to identify robust performance markers. In the Test phase scale-up issues will be tackled, notably focused on the challenge of moving from microtiter scale highthroughput cultivation and analytical methods will be deployed to assess performance of hundreds or thousands of strains. This stage does not allow well controlled culture conditions, neither a broad range of analytics. Consequently the challenges lie on one hand on how to measure in a predictable manner the desired outcome of the strain design, and on the other that right strains will be selected, which would also perform as designed in controlled bioreactors, and have predicted process adaptability to larger production scales.
