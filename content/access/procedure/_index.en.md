### 1.   Who is this section meant for

All researchers and SMEs working in EU Member States (EU-28), but also to Associated Countries and Third Countries. You can also check the bi-lateral Science & Technology (S&T) agreements signed by the European Commission with a number of individual countries.
### 2.   How will this section help the user
 
Users will get a thorough description of the application procedure in order to successfully apply for subsidised access to the IBISBA R&D services. 
### 3.   What is the learning outcome/goal of a section
 
Users will be instructed on the application procedure, including general conditions and eligibility criteria, to get subsidised access to the IBISBA research infrastructure.
### 4.   Stepwise instructions

Subsidised access is provided ONLY during Open Calls, during which applicants are requested to submit a full proposal through the IBISBA website. This will automatically be sent to the TNA Administrator and go through different filters in order to be selected, discarded or saved for consultancy (and be presented to another call).

A one stage application process with cut-off dates will be applied to gather and select proposals.

Caveat: in the event of project rejection, the project proposer will receive a short rejection statement, but will not receive extensive arguments supporting the decision. In certain circumstances, IBISBA administrators will directly contact project PIs to discuss submission at a later stage, although this is not mandatory and is left to the discretion of IBISBA administrators.

Once proposals have been submitted, the TNA Administrator will check the eligibility of the proposed access.


Eligibility criteria

Transnationality
Obligation to use infrastructure services in a member state or than that of one's usual place of work (user nationality is irrelevant). For multiple services (max 3), use of national facilities may be possible, but these will not be subsidised by IBISBA.

Project profile
Type: continuum of services. Projects are limited to 1 access on the same platform and to a total of 3 accesses,

Date and time of submission
The application should be sent before the deadline officially published on the website.

Science impact
An Expert Selection Panel will help IBISBA administrators to appreciate the quality of each application. However, the TNA administrator and the Executive Board of IBISBA are fully responsible for the final decisions regarding TNA service requests.

Evaluation criteria: 		Project Scientific excellence, maturity and purposefulness
				Methodology and Implementation
				Originality and innovative nature of the project
				Relevance/Complementary with IBISBA aims and TNA offer

Feasibility
Projects that are successfully evaluated will be submitted to a pre-service feasibility screen. This vital step will be performed by a qualified panel and the TNA Administrator. Recommendations made by the feasibility panel might require modifications to the original service request.

Evaluation criteria:		Methodology and Implementation
				Feasibility of the project

Validation
Once the evaluation process is completed, final decisions on service requests are taken by the IBISBA Executive Board.

Access offer - Final Results
Results of TNA calls are published on the IBISBA website and individual project proposers are contacted by email. Successful applicants have 10 working days to confirm acceptance of the TNA service offer using the appropriate form to do this.

Duration
Up to 6 months

Compliance with format
Within the application form, all fields must be completed using “Corbel (or Arial) font, size 10” characters, single-spaced (as set by default).

N.B.:  Proposals that are incomplete, not in conformity with the recommended format or are too lengthy will not be reviewed. Proposals must be uploaded to the electronic submission system, named in the following format: ACRONYM_TNA4_COUNTRYCODE.


Platform & Offer

Services provided and the facilities can be found on the website. TNA applicants should note that, at any given time, not all services on the website might be eligible for subsidised access. Moreover, in the case of multiple service requests, it is possible that applicants will be asked to provide co-funding to cover full project costs.

Ethics self-assessment checklist

Users will have to answer questions related to ethics issues associated with their proposals, making sure they cover all the topics illustrated in the ethics self-assessment checklist.


TNA funding

IBISBA will offer on-site services and remote services.

On-Site Services
It means physical visits, by one user identified in the proposal. The IBISBA partner hosting the TNA visit will contribute to the cost of travelling/living expenses. As mentioned above, IBISBA provides subsidies to users. However, prolonged work stays at facilities or multiple service offers may involve co-funding by users.

Remote Services
It means access to laboratory services and facilities/equipment. Users send their samples for analysis, but do not physically visit the site. The site manager will be responsible for making measurements and analysis.

N.B.: Obviously, remote access is not expected to incur travel/living expenses. However, in order to ease project feasibility, on-site presence can be foreseen between the applicant and the welcoming host. Related costs will be supported by users.

Travel and subsistence

IBISBA will subsidise the costs of travel and subsistence incurred during physical site visits. Rates will vary depending on the guest institution and the country where the TNA site is located and on the duration of the stay. The contribution to subsistence costs (i.e. accommodation, meals, local transport such as buses and taxis, etc.) and may not cover all costs.

Travel costs will be taken care of OR reimbursed by the guest institution, following their internal rule. In all cases, reimbursement of expenses will favour the most cost efficient option. For further information, please check the table enclosed at the end of this section.

Ineligible expenses

IBISBA will not subsidise the cost of visas, passports, travel insurance, personal shopping, tourism or any other costs related to personal convenience. For on-site services, users are fully responsible for ensuring that they have insurance to cover accidents, illness and other events during their stay at the host institution.


Obligation to Publish Results/Acknowledgement

Obligation to Publish Results

Transnational Access within IBISBA is an activity subsidised by the European Commission. Therefore, in accordance with rules that apply to the H2020 programme, users are expected to ensure that data generated through TNA is made FAIR and that work is published in open access journals or made available on an open access platform (e.g. open archives)*. Moreover, in compliance with IBISBA rules, TNA users will be required to supply a project report (see below).

*in accordance with European Commission regulations, SMEs are exempted from this rule.

Acknowledgement
Acknowledgement of the access provided to users must be included in the publication, specifying that the project leading to the publication was subsidised by the IBISBA project. The mandatory statement is:

e.g.: partial funding of this was provided by the Transnational Access to Research Infrastructures scheme operated by the IBISBA project, which is funded by the H2020 Framework Programme of the European Commission (grant agreement n. 730976)

Additionally, the host partner organisation should be acknowledged, according to host partner user and requirements.

Intellectual Property Rules for SMEs
SMEs are covered by the specific European Commission regulation. Remains for them the obligation to acknowledge the use of network and infrastructure, no obligation to publish for open access, and an optional participation in success stories.


Post Access Requirements
It will be mandatory for users to submit a full project report following IBISBA guidelines. In particular, this report will require users to clearly define the input and output parameters that are associated with their project. Users will also be required to complete a satisfaction survey and supply all documents required for reimbursement of costs. 

### 5.   Summary/Next Steps
Subsidised access to IBISBA R&D services requires that users submit project proposals that are well aligned with the aims of IBISBA and meet technical, scientific and ethical requirements. Once users have drafted their proposal, they need to create an account on the website submission page and upload the proposal on the electronic submission system.  

### 6.  Frequently asked questions
 
Is it possible to modify the proposal after the submission?
Yes, it is, as long as changes are applied before the submission deadline.

Can I apply to another Open Call even though I have already been selected previously?
Unfortunately, it is not possible to apply for another Call if the user has already got access to the infrastructure. Otherwise, one can apply as many times as they want. 

Will proposals requesting multiple services be prioritised in the selection process?
The selection process takes into account multiple aspects of the proposals, e.g. the scientific impact and the feasibility, therefore, multi-service requests are encouraged, but they are not a preferential way.
